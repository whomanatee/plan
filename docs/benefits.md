By creating the GI, these changes will naturally unfold over time, providing comprehensive benefits for all and leading to the eradication of crime and societal issues.

The GI envisions a future where outdated and exploitative systems, such as profit-driven services that do not contribute to the GI and its members, traditional governance structures, and privatized essential resources, are no longer needed. By establishing a community-driven, resource-based economy that prioritizes human well-being over profit, the GI will make these obsolete systems irrelevant. Through cooperative management, sustainable practices, and equitable distribution of resources, members will no longer rely on systems that perpetuate inequality, financial stress, or environmental harm. In their place, new structures will foster collaboration, shared prosperity, and security for all.
