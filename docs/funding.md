# Step 2: Funding World Amazing: The Core Fund, Beyond the Core Fund, and Governance
The GI framework is designed to mobilize significant resources by engaging approximately 10% of the global population, targeting one billion people to contribute a base membership fee of $25,000 each. This strategy would create a fund totaling $25 trillion. Annually, the institution plans to use 4% of this total fund—amounting to $1 trillion—to finance its operations and initiatives from 2025 through at least 2050. This substantial budget will be primarily allocated to acquiring land and resources, essential for building a self-sufficient infrastructure and laying the groundwork for a globally integrated community.

- **Member-Controlled Financial Contributions**: Upon joining, each member's contribution is deposited into a personal account, akin to a savings account, where control over these funds remains legally with the member. This ensures that all spending decisions require member approval, embodying a democratic and transparent process where your money is your vote, and each dollar remains under your legal control indefinitely.
- **Ethical and Strategic Use of Funds**: No part of the membership fees will be used for salaries or personal enrichment. All collected funds are dedicated to acquiring land and resources necessary for providing goods and services to all members. This approach ensures that the GI core fund operates on a non-profit basis, focusing solely on enhancing the community's collective well-being.
- **Inclusive and Equitable Participation**: The GI framework is inclusive, offering pathways to membership through meaningful work for those who cannot afford the $25,000 fee. This ensures that financial barriers do not exclude willing and valuable individuals from contributing to and benefiting from the GI's initiatives. It reinforces the institution’s commitment to inclusivity and equal opportunity for all, regardless of economic status.
- **Democratic Decision-Making and Resource Allocation**: Every member is given the opportunity to influence how funds are allocated. This democratic approach ensures that everyone, regardless of their financial contribution, has a seat at the decision-making table. Members can persuade others on the best uses of the core fund, promoting a culture of active participation and shared governance.
- **Option for Personal Salary Fund**: Members have the opportunity to grow their personal funds by engaging in or starting projects within the institution. While no member will require a salary to cover essential living costs—since these are provided by the institution—the ability to earn through contributions to institution projects ensures that members can achieve financial growth and personal development within the GI framework.

## Membership Levels Beyond the Core
The GI framework introduces a tiered membership system designed to recognize various forms of member contributions. Members can ascend to higher levels through one of three ways: direct financial contributions, revenue from successful GI projects, or recognition for exceptional non-financial contributions. Each level signifies a deeper engagement with and contribution to the GI, carrying perks and increased financial influence within the community. The specifics of the benefits associated with each tier will be developed collaboratively within the GI community, ensuring they reflect the collective values and goals of all members.

### Membership Tiers
The proposed levels include:

- **$100,000**
- **$1 million**
- **$10 million**
- **$100 million**
- **$1 billion**
- **$10 billion**
- **$100 billion**
- **Beyond $100 billion**

## Pathways to Higher Membership Levels
Members can achieve higher tiers through one of three primary pathways:

1. **Direct Financial Contributions:** Members can achieve higher membership levels by directly investing amounts that correspond to specific tiers. For example, by investing $100,000, a member qualifies for the corresponding membership level. This investment grants them the ability to personally spend an equivalent amount—$100,000—in the GI marketplace. Due to the GI's operational efficiencies and the unique economic model, spending within the GI marketplace will offer a higher value compared to traditional markets. This means that the $100,000 spent in the GI marketplace could have the purchasing power equivalent to a significantly higher amount in a conventional market, effectively doubling or even tripling the value of their spending. Thus, their initial financial contribution not only supports the GI’s projects and initiatives but also retains substantial value for personal use within the ecosystem, preserving and likely enhancing their purchasing power.

2. **Revenue from GI Projects:** Members can achieve higher membership levels by leading or significantly contributing to projects that generate revenue within the GI. For instance, to reach the $100,000 tier, a member would need their project to generate a net profit of $200,000. This profit is then divided equally, with $100,000 going into the member's GI project fund, which they directly control and can use to fund future projects or initiatives. The other $100,000 is credited to their personal salary fund, available for use within the GI marketplace or for personal saving. This structure rewards members for successful project outcomes and enhances their financial influence within the GI.

3. **Recognition for Outstanding Contributions:** Members who make significant non-financial contributions—such as exceptional community service, innovation, or leadership—can be elevated to higher membership levels in recognition of their efforts. For instance, if a member's contributions are deemed extraordinary enough to warrant elevation to the $100,000 level, they will be awarded $100,000 for their personal project fund and an additional $100,000 in their salary fund. This acknowledgment ensures that invaluable contributions of skills, expertise, and leadership are rewarded equivalently to financial investments, empowering these members to have a greater impact within the GI while enjoying enhanced benefits in the GI marketplace.

## Benefits of Higher Levels
- **Enhanced Economic Impact**: The influx of funds from these higher tiers significantly expands the GI's financial capabilities, enabling a broader range of ambitious projects and infrastructure developments. This additional capital ensures that the GI can pursue large-scale endeavors that might be beyond the scope of the initial core fund, from advanced technological research to expansive ecological restoration projects.
- **Strategic Goal: Transition to GI Economy**: The ultimate objective of introducing these tiers is to encourage the transition of personal, corporate, and institutional funds from traditional economies into the GI economy. By offering superior value and impact per dollar spent within the GI marketplace, the framework aims to render traditional economic systems obsolete. This shift not only consolidates the GI's economic base but also aligns global financial resources with sustainable and equitable growth, making the GI a central hub for future economic activity worldwide.
- **Broadening the GI's Impact**: With these additional resources, the GI can extend its influence and capabilities, funding a wide array of projects that can have transformative effects on both local and global scales. This not only furthers the GI's mission but also attracts further investments and projects, creating a virtuous cycle of growth and innovation.

## Empowering Economic Engagement: Removing Barriers to Wealth
In the Global Institution, the concept of wealth is reimagined to remove barriers traditionally associated with financial success. Members are encouraged to use their additional free time—afforded by the GI’s two-day workweek—to engage in or initiate projects within the institution. This flexibility allows members to contribute to existing projects or start new ones that align with the GI’s principles and their personal interests. While these endeavors are not primarily driven by profit motives, they could potentially generate revenue. This not only supports the institution's initiatives but also enhances the economic well-being of its members, fostering a dynamic environment where creativity and enterprise thrive.

The GI framework envisions a community where having substantial financial resources is not seen as a problem but as an opportunity to drive communal and global improvement. By encouraging all members to potentially accumulate significant financial resources, the GI aims to dismantle the old paradigms of economic exclusivity. This strategy ensures that every member has the chance to achieve financial success without the traditional barriers, contributing both to personal prosperity and the collective good. The institution's framework is designed to ensure that profits are used ethically, supporting sustainable projects that align with the GI’s core values of inclusivity, sustainability, and community development.

Every contribution within the GI, whether through direct financial investments, project-based earnings, or recognized non-financial efforts, serves a dual purpose. Not only does it enhance the member's position and experience within our community, but it also directly contributes to the broader vision of eradicating economic barriers and fostering a sustainable and equitable world. As members invest in the GI, they're investing in a future where economic systems are not just fairer but also purposefully aligned with global well-being. This ensures that their actions, both large and small, are integral to the collective journey towards a world where freedom and prosperity are accessible to all, demonstrating the power of a united effort in making substantial, lasting changes.
