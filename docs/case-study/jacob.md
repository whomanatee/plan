**Before the Global Institution (GI)**:
Jacob served as a pilot in the IDF Air Force, where he carried out missions that were meant to defend his nation. One tragic mission went awry, resulting in the unintended loss of a civilian family, a burden that weighed heavily on his conscience. Living with the guilt and the haunting images of the aftermath, Jacob found himself questioning the very essence of his duties and the costs of conflict.

**Encounter with the Global Institution**:
Post-military, Jacob’s path intersected with the GI when he attended a lecture on peace and reconciliation. The stories shared by former combatants from various conflicts around the world opened his eyes to the universality of suffering and the potential for healing.

**Transformation and Healing**:
Jacob became actively involved with the GI’s programs focused on healing for veterans and victims of conflict. He participated in workshops where he learned to channel his experiences into advocacy for non-violent solutions in conflict resolution.

**A New Role**:
Finding new purpose, Jacob initiated a project under the GI to create dialogues between former military personnel and civilians from conflict zones. These dialogues aimed to foster understanding and promote healing on both sides. He shared his story openly, not to seek absolution, but to highlight the urgent need for alternative approaches to resolving disputes.

**Legacy of Peace**:
Jacob’s efforts grew into a wider program sponsored by the GI, which was implemented in various conflict regions to help others cope with similar experiences. His commitment to peace became his way of honoring the lives lost and contributing to a future where such tragedies are avoided.
