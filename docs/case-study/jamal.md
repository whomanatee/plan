Through Jamal's story, the case study illustrates how personal accountability, combined with systemic support, can lead to deep personal change and active participation in peace-building efforts.

**Before the Global Institution (GI)**:
Jamal's early life in a conflict-ridden community led him down a path of violence, culminating in his involvement in the October 7th attack. Caught in a cycle of anger and retaliation, his actions reflected a broader sense of hopelessness and despair.

**Transformation through the Global Institution**:
After encountering the GI, Jamal experienced a shift in perspective through programs that emphasized rehabilitation, education, and reconciliation. These programs introduced him to new ways of thinking and provided the tools for self-reflection and transformation.

**Personal Reflection and Growth**:
Jamal's engagement with the GI brought him into contact with mentors who had similar backgrounds and had turned their lives around. These relationships were instrumental in his journey, helping him to process his past and envision a different future.

**A New Purpose**:
Determined to prevent others from following his past path, Jamal became deeply involved in the GIâ€™s initiatives to educate and empower youth in conflict zones. He worked to teach skills in non-violent communication and conflict resolution, using his own experiences as a powerful teaching tool.

**Legacy and Ongoing Transformation**:
Today, Jamal is a vocal advocate for peace, sharing his transformation from a perpetrator of violence to a proponent of reconciliation. His story is used in GI workshops to inspire and educate others about the power of change and the importance of peace.

This narrative underscores the capacity for redemption and the significant role that education and community support play in transforming lives and building a peaceful future.
