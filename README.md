# The Global Institution Plan
> A 100% public open-source framework designed for everyone worldwide to live extraordinarily.

> The framework proposes working only 2 days per week on average, retiring from intensive physical or mental work by age 50, and eliminating base essential living expenses such as housing, utilities, healthcare, education, casualwear, groceries, basic yearly vacations, and pet health coverage.

> Supported by a new economic model that champions the individual, the family, the community, and beyond, this plan outlines transformative approaches to the concepts of work, wealth, health, prosperity, harmony, and joy on a global scale.
