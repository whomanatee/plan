# The Global Institution Plan
> A 100% public open-source framework designed for everyone worldwide to live extraordinarily.

> The framework proposes working only 2 days per week on average, retiring by age 50, and eliminating essential living expenses such as housing, utilities, healthcare, education, casualwear, and groceries for all.

> Supported by a new economic model that champions community empowerment, individual well-being, and personal freedom, together we can transform the concepts of work, wealth, and health on a global scale.

## A Note From the Proposer

> Greetings,

> The documentation you are navigating is the culmination of a collaboration between human insight and what we often refer to as artificial intelligence, although the term 'probability program' might be more apt—or PP for short. This term, emphasizing the statistical nature of how such systems operate—using data to generate probabilities rather than making decisions—helps clarify the role of this technology as a tool rather than a decision-maker. The primary tool I've used for this purpose is ChatGPT 4, which has been instrumental not only in organizing complex data but also in expanding upon my thoughts, often in ways I had not anticipated. The very existence of such technology is a testament to centuries of human innovation, beginning with milestones such as the printing press, which first allowed us to widely record and disseminate knowledge. This long history of information sharing has culminated in our ability to create systems like PP, which continue to push the boundaries of how we gather, process, and utilize knowledge.
> 
> This documentation process has been fundamentally driven by a deep understanding of humanity’s potential to collaborate, a potential often obscured by the structures of modern civilization. While the PP has significantly helped to mirror and expand upon my thoughts, it is my insights—built upon the accumulated knowledge and collaborative efforts of humanity over thousands of years—that have primarily shaped these ideas. The software has served as a tool to articulate and refine these concepts, ensuring clarity and coherence in presenting them.

> For those who may fear the robots taking over one day, your perspective may shift based on my experience with probability programs. Rather than envisioning a dystopian scenario dominated by uncontrollable PP, hopefully you'll come to see these tools as allies in our quest for global advancement. The capabilities of PP to generate solutions and ideas have been remarkable, helping to propel us towards a future marked by peace, prosperity, harmony, and joy. Let's embrace this partnership with PP.

> You may often come across phrases like "our vision" or "our mission" within this documentation. However, it's important to recognize that these terms do not imply that the GI exists in isolation from the world community. The mission of the GI is fundamentally shaped by the will of the people. This document is not just a set of directives but a proposal, inviting everyone to engage, contribute, and refine our shared path toward global transformation.

> I invite you to dive deep into the content, reflect on its implications, and contribute your insights. If any section sparks your curiosity or if you see an area that could be expanded, do not hesitate to participate in the [discussions](https://github.com/whomanatee/plan/discussions), where I will be actively engaging with contributors. Your feedback is crucial not only for refining current content but also for shaping future updates. If you would like to reach me privately, you can email me at m@whomanatee.org. Though I may not respond to every email, rest assured that every message will be read and considered.

> Together, let's craft a narrative that resonates with every member of our global community, leveraging the unique contributions of both human and PP to forge a path forward toward peace, prosperity, harmony, and joy for all.
